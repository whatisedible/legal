# 7. Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law. Our record-keeping practices are in compliance with relevant laws. We will keep and utilize your information as needed to manage our relationship with you, enhance your personalized customer experience, meet our legal obligations (such as retaining your information to comply with tax or revenue laws), resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as otherwise detailed in this Privacy Policy.

In some circumstances, we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you), in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

# 8. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information. We make efforts to protect against accidental loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

However, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission, or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.

# 9. International Data Transfer

Your personal information may be collected, used, processed, transferred, and retained by us, and our service providers in multiple countries (including Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Economic Area (“EEA”)) which may be outside the region in which you are situated and may have different privacy or data protection legislation, and may therefore be subject to the laws of these countries.

Specifically, our Services are hosted in Europe, and our affiliates and service providers operate around the world, including in Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any of these countries which have differing levels of protection for personal information.

Since we are subject to the GDPR, we would only transfer your personal information to countries that are recognized under the GDPR and UK law as having an adequate level of data protection. In cases where such adequacy isn't automatically ensured, we take the necessary steps to establish or confirm that all recipients of your data will maintain an adequate level of data protection. This often involves entering into suitable data transfer agreements that adhere to Standard Contractual Clauses.

# 10. Third-Party Links

Our Website may contain links to other third-party websites. We do not endorse, screen, or approve, the privacy practices or content of such other websites. If you choose to follow a link to any of these third-party websites, please be aware that they may have their own privacy policies and we do not assume any responsibility for or liability for their policies or how they process your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us.

# 11. Your Rights

Under the relevant and applicable law, you may have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These rights are set out below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set out in section 13. These rights include:

- **Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data corrected, supplemented, anonymized, or deleted.
